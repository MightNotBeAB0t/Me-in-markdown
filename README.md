# Me in Markdown
## Introduction
Hello, my name is Patrick Chung and I am in 10th grade.

My favorite movie is John Wick because how detailed the choreography and universe is.

I recently learned how to fish over the summer. I was able to catch 5 fish and be able to bring them home for my family.

Something unique about me: I am the oldest of 13 cousins in my family.

My goal for the school year is to pass every class and just get through the year.

Over the summer I went to Europe for my younger brother's soccer tournament. (He lost every single game). In my opinion the food was not much better compared to here, it was insanely humid and scorching hot. I got to go to Italy and Spain.

My favorite dish was an oven baked Baracuda (fish) that we caught during our fishing trip. It's special because it's fruit of our efforts.

I aim to achieve at least a 3 or more for the AP test in this class. Also pass the class with an A.

The most memorable experience during the summer was when I went to Europe. It was an new experience to see the world outside the US. Different cultures and day to day life.

A tech project I did was make a roblox game for our class's PBL (project based learning). It was difficult because we didn't learn the language for Roblox.

I play the sport Golf, and i'm on the school's golf team. I went out to the course recently to practice, and shot so horribly. I feel like I have degraded in skill.

I have not participated in any creative endevors, or volunteer work of any kind yet. I need to get my hours soon though.

I didn't participate in any family traditions or activities during the summer because I don't think there are any during summer months in Korean culture.

My favorite memory with friends during the summer was when I went fishing. I went fishing with my friend's family. I got to stay overnight at his house, something I haven't done since I was 8. It was nice to experience something new while with him.

Fishing has helped me realize that, it's not for me. Sure Il go once or twice a year, but not more often than that. I don't like slime and feel of picking them up. Plus it was a 6-hour round trip on a small boat. The whole time just in the ocean.
